# Implement a Planning Search

## Synopsis

This project solves deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent. 
Computes optimal plans with progression search algorithms.  Unlike the navigation problem, there is no simple distance heuristic to aid the agent. 
Instead, I implemented domain-independent heuristics.
